# 10-6. Addition: One common problem when prompting for numerical input 
# occurs when people provide text instead of numbers. When you try to convert 
# the input to an int, youâ€™ll get a ValueError. Write a program that prompts for 
# two numbers. Add them together and print the result. Catch the ValueError if 
# either input value is not a number, and print a friendly error message. Test your 
# program by entering two numbers and then by entering some text instead of a 
# number. 

prompt = "Please enter two numbers\n"
prompt += "or type 'q' to exit. "
