# 6-9. Favorite Places: Make a dictionary called favorite_places. Think of three 
# names to use as keys in the dictionary, and store one to three favorite places 
# for each person. To make this exercise a bit more interesting, ask some friends 
# to name a few of their favorite places. Loop through the dictionary, and print 
# each personâ€™s name and their favorite places

    'erin': ['eiffel tower', 'usa', 'burger kings'],

}
