# 6-8. Pets: Make several dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a different pet. 
# In each dictionary, include the kind of animal and the ownerâ€™s name. 
# Store these dictionaries in a list called pets. Next, loop through your list and as 
# you do, print everything you know about each pet.
